    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">1.Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h3>
        <P style="font-family:Arial;">No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing.<br>The starting and ending point parts of an HTML document are HTML Tags, which start with < (less than) and end with >(greater than) angle bracket, and whatever is written inside the angle brackets are known as tags.<br>
            Example:<b>HTML tag-&lt;b&gt;..&lt;/b&gt;</b><br>
           Elements in HTML enclose the content in between the tags. It consists of an expression or a structure. Its architecture consists of a start tag, content followed by an ending tag.<br>
           Example:<b>HTML element-&lt;p&gt;some content&lt;/p&gt;</b><br><br>

    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">2.What are tags and attributes in HTML?</h3> 
        <p style="font-family:Arial;"> Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They begin with < symbol and end with > symbol. Whatever written inside < and > are called tags.Both opening and closing tags must be there in order to function. There are also some self enclosing tags which require only one tag. The ending slash over here is optional.<br>
            Example:<b>HTML tag-&lt;b&gt;..&lt;/b&gt;</b><br>
           HTML attributes are the special words placed inside the opening tags and used to define the characteristics of an HTML element. The HTML attributes contain two parts, attribute name, and its value. The attribute pairs (attribute_name, attribute_value) are separated using equal (=) operator. The attribute value is closed inside double quotes (” “).<br>
           Example:<b>HTML attribute-&lt;img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog."&gt;</b> 

    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">3.What are void elements in HTML?With example.</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">There is a special group of elements that only have start tags and does not contain any content within it, these elements are called void elements. Void elements doesn’t have ending tags and can only have attributes but do not contain any kind of content. These elements can have backslash before ending of start tag but that is completely optional.<br>
          Example:<b>void elements-&lt;br&gt;,&lt;hr&gt;,&lt;img&gt;,&lt;input&gt;,&lt;link&gt;,&lt;base&gt;,&lt;meta&gt;,&lt;param&gt;,&lt;area&gt;,&lt;embed&gt;,&lt;col&gt;,&lt;track&gt;,&lt;source&gt; etc.</b>

    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">4.What are HTML Entities? With Example.</h3>
       <p style="font-family:Arial;">HTML provides some method to display reserved characters. Reserved characters are those characters that are either reserved for HTML or those which are not present in the basic keyboard. For instance, ‘<‘ is reserved in HTML language.
         Sometimes this character needs to display on the web page which creates ambiguity in code. Along with these are the characters which are normally not present in basic keyboard ( £, ¥, €, © ), etc. HTML provides some Entity names and Entity numbers to use these symbols. Entity names are case-sensitive. Entity number is easy to learn.<br> 
         Syntax:
         &entity_name; or &#entity_number;<br>
         Example:<b>HTML entities are declared using an ampersand (&) with (#) pound character and finally ended with a semicolon(;)</b>

    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">5.What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example.</h3>
       <p style="font-family:Arial;">HTML lists allow the content to follow a proper semantic structure. All the tags in the list require opening and closing tags. There are 3 types of lists in HTML, namely:Unordered List,Ordered List,Description List.<br><br>
       <b>1.Unordered list:</b>An Unordered list is used to create a list of related items, in bulleted or unordered format. It starts with the &lt;ul&gt; tag, followed by the &lt;li&gt; tag to show list items inside &lt;ul&gt; tag.<br>
       Example:
       <ul>
        <li>peacock</li>
        <li>sparrow</li>
        <li>parrot</li>
       </ul> 
       <p style="font-family:Arial;"><b>2.Ordered list:</b>The Ordered lists have an order which is either numerical or alphabetical. The &lt;ol&gt; tag is used to create ordered lists in HTML and just like unordered list, we use &lt;li&gt; tag to define or show lists inside &lt;ol&gt; tag.<br>
       Example:
       <ol>
        <li>Mango</li>
        <li>Strawberry</li>
        <li>Grapes</li>
       </ol>
       <p style="font-family:Arial;"><b>3.Description list:</b>A description list is a type of list where each item has a description. It is also known as a definition list. The &lt;dl&gt; tag is used to create description list, the &lt;dt&gt; tag defines the item, and the &lt;dd&gt; tag describes each item in list.<br>
        Example:
        <dl>
            <dt>Tiger</dt>
            <dd>Tiger is an animal.</dd>
            <dt>Apple</dt>
            <dd>Apple is a fruit.</dd>
        </dl>

    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">6.What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">The class is an attribute that specifies one or more class names for an HTML element.The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.Multiple HTML elements can share the same class. HTML elements can belong to more than one class.To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space.<br>
        Example:<br><b>In the following example, the first &lt;h2&gt; element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class.<br>
        &lt;h2 class="city main"&gt;London&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
        &lt;h2 class="city"&gt;Paris&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
        &lt;h2 class="city"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/h2&gt;</b>

    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">7.What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements? With Example.</h3>    
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">The id attribute is a unique identifier that is used to specify the document. It is used by CSS and JavaScript to perform a certain task for a unique element. In CSS, the id attribute is written using the # symbol followed by id.<br>
        Example:<br><b>&lt;p id="geeks"&gt;Welcome to Geeks for Geeks&lt;/p&gt;<br>
        In CSS stylesheet:<br>#geeks{
            color: green;
            font-size: 25px;
        }</b><br>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">The class is an attribute that specifies one or more class names for an HTML element.The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.Multiple HTML elements can share the same class. HTML elements can belong to more than one class.To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space.<br>
        Example:<br><b>In the following example, the first &lt;h2&gt; element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class.<br>
        &lt;h2 class="city main"&gt;London&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
        &lt;h2 class="city"&gt;Paris&lt;/h2&gt;<br>
        &lt;h2 class="city"&gt;Tokyo&lt;/h2&gt;</b> 

    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">8.What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;"> HTML provides many predefined elements that are used to change the formatting of text. The formatting can be used to set the text styles (like – bold, italic, or emphasized, etc.), highlight the text, make text superscript and subscript, etc.<br>
        Example:<br><b>&lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; Tags are used to make the text bold.<br>
                    &lt;i&gt; and &lt;em&gt; Tags are used to make the text italic and emphasized.<br>
                    The &lt;small&gt; tag is used to set small font-size where as &lt;big&gt; tag is used to set big font-size.<br>
                    The &lt;sup&gt; tag is used to superscript a text whereas &lt;sub&gt; tag is used to subscript a text.<br>
                    The &lt;ins&gt; tag is used to underline a text marking the part as inserted or added.This tag is mainly used in text in place of deleted text whereas the &lt;del&gt; tag is used to delete the text it adds a strike line to the text.<br>
                    The &lt;mark&gt; tag is used to highlight a text.</b>
                    
    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">9.How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.</h3>  
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">  Cellpadding specifies the space between the border of a table cell and its contents (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the cell edge and the content of the cell.<br>
         Syntax:&lt;table cellpadding="value"&gt;.....&lt;/table&gt;<br>
         Cellspacing specifies the space between cells (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the edges of the adjacent cells.<br>
         Syntax:&lt;table cellspacing="value"&gt;.....&lt;/table&gt;<br>
         Example:<br> <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200714153546/diffbetcolsp.png" alt="">
    
    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">10.How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table? With Example.</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">It can be done by using the rowspan and colspan attribute in HTML.The rowspan is used to merge or combine the number of cells in a row whereas the colspan is used to merge column cells in a table.In other words,colspan allows a single table cell to span the width of more than one cell or column and rowspan allows a single table cell to span the height of more than one cell or row.<br>
        Example:<br> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ULm5Z.jpg" alt="">

    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">11.What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h3>
        <table border="" style="font-family:Arial;" cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="3px">
            <tr>
                <th>Inline elements</th>
                <th>Block Elements </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements occupy only sufficient width required.</td>
                <td>Block Elements occupy the full width irrespective of their sufficiency.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements don’t start in a new line.</td>
                <td>Block elements always start in a line.</td>  
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements allow other inline elements to sit behind.</td>
                <td>Block elements doesn’t allow other elements to sit behind</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Inline elements don’t have top and bottom margin.</td>
                <td>Block elements have top and bottom margin.</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Example:&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;a&gt;,&lt;span&gt;,&lt;img&gt;</td>
                <td>Example:&lt;div&gt;,&lt;p&gt;,&lt;h1&gt;,&lt;ul&gt;/&lt;li&gt;</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    
    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">12. How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? With Example.</h3> 
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">HTML links are hyperlinks.You can click on a link and jump to another document.When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand. A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element.<br>
        The HTML &lt;a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:<br>&lt;a href="url"&gt;link text&lt;/a&gt;<br>
        The most important attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.<br>
        Example:  <b>&lt;a href="https://www.shopsy.in/"&gt;<a href="https://www.shopsy.in/">visit shopsy</a>&lt;/a&gt;</b>  
        
    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">13. What is the use of an iframe tag? With Example.</h3> 
    <p style="font-family:Arial;">The iframe in HTML stands for Inline Frame. The ” iframe ” tag defines a rectangular region within the document in which the browser can display a separate document, including scrollbars and borders. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document. The HTML iframe name attribute is used to specify a reference for an &lt;iframe&gt; element. The name attribute is also used as a reference to the elements in JavaScript. The iframe is basically used to show a webpage inside the current web page. The ‘ src ‘ attribute is used to specify the URL of the document that occupies the iframe.<br>
        Syntax:<b>&lt;iframe src="URL" title="description"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</b>
        
    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">14. What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example.</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content. It is used to group elements for styling purposes (by using the class or id attributes), A better way to use it when no other semantic element is available.The span tag is a paired tag means it has both open(<) and closing (>) tags, and it is mandatory to close the tag. The span tag is used for the grouping of inline elements & this tag does not make any visual change by itself. span is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag.<br>
        Syntax: &lt;span class=""&gt;Some Text&lt;/span&gt;<br>
        Example:<br> <b>&lt;span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;<br>
        Output:</b><span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">computer science</span>

    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">15.How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page? With Example.</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">Background images are used to make a website more interactive and attractive. It can be applied in many stylings.<br><br>
            1.In the body tag, specify a background image in the background attribute by passing the URL of the image or location path.<br>
            Example:<b>&lt;body background = "https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/22/400595-minimalism-simple_background-black-text-typography.jpg"&gt;NO WALLPAPER&lt;/body&gt;<br>
            Output:</b><br><img src="https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/22/400595-minimalism-simple_background-black-text-typography.jpg" width="200px" height="150px" alt=""><br><br>
            2.Adding CSS styling properties.<br>
            Example:<b><br>
                &lt;style&gt;<br>
                body {background-image:url("https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/22/400595-minimalism-simple_background-black-text-typography.jpg");}<br>
                &lt;/style&gt;<br>
            Output:</b><br> <img src="https://wallup.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/22/400595-minimalism-simple_background-black-text-typography.jpg" width="200px" height="150px" alt=""> 
            
    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">16.How are active links different from normal links?</h3> 
       <p style="font-family:Arial;">Links are established in simple HTML web pages through &lt;a&gt; tag.<br><br>
        Normal link:The following example shows the basic example for Normal Link ( Unvisited Link ). If you want to create a link to go to “https://www.shopsy.in/“, you can get the normal link through this code. The default color is blue color and underlined but you can apply your own custom styling according to the application’s need.<br>
        <b>&lt;a href="https://www.shopsy.in/"&gt;<a href="https://www.shopsy.in/">visit shopsy</a>&lt;/a&gt;</b><br><br>
        Active link: In above example, If you left or right-click any one of the links Visited or Unvisited, it will turn into Red and Underline. Active Links shows that the browser is in the process to load a new resource.You can do your own custom styling using CSS :active selector. In the above output, notice the active link on right-click of the link.<br>
        Example:<br> <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210921175259/activelink.png"  width="300px" height="150px" alt=""> 
        
    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">17. What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</h3>
       <p style="font-family:Arial;">Three tags are used to separate the texts.<br>
       <b>&lt;br&gt; tag</b> - Usually &lt;br&gt; tag is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and conveys the flow to the next line.<br>
       <b>&lt;p&gt; tag</b> - The &lt;p&gt; tag contains the text in the form of a new paragraph.<br>
       <b>&lt;blockquote&gt; tag</b> - It is used to define a large quoted section. If you have a large quotation, then put the entire text within &lt;blockquote&gt;.............&lt;/blockquote&gt; tag.     
            
    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">18.What is SVG?</h3>
       <p style="font-family:Arial;">SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.<br>
        SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web. <br>
        SVG defines the graphics in XML format. <br>
        Every element and every attribute in SVG files can be animated. <br>
        SVG is a W3C recommendation. <br>
        SVG integrates with other W3C standards such as the DOM and XSL.<br>
        A file with the SVG file extension is most likely a Scalable Vector Graphics file. Files in this format use an XML-based text format to describe how the image should appear.Since text is used to describe the graphic, an SVG file can be scaled to different sizes without losing quality—the format is resolution-independent. This is why website and print graphics are often built in the SVG format, so they can be resized to fit different designs in the future.<br>
        Example:<br> <img src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/svg_scaled_600x.jpg?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1" width="300px" height="150px" alt="">

    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">19.What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h3> 
    <table border="" style="font-family:Arial;" cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="3px">
    <tr>
        <th>HTML</th>
        <th>XHTML</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</td>
        <td>XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>It is extended from SGML.</td>
        <td>It is extended from XML and HTML.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>All tags and attributes are not necessarily to be in lower or upper case.</td>
        <td>In this, every tag and attribute should be in lower case.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>It is not necessary to close the tags in the order they are opened.</td>
        <td>It is necessary to close the tags in the order they are opened.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Filename extension used are .html, .htm.</td>
        <td>Filename extension are .xhtml, .xht, .xml.</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <h3 style="color:blueviolet;">20.What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</h3> 
    <p style="font-family:Arial;">Logical tags are used to tell the browser what kind of text is written inside the tags. They are different from physical tags because physical tags are used to decide the appearance of the text and do not provide any information about the text.Logical Tags are used in HTML to display the text according to the logical styles.<br>
    Physical Tags are used to indicate that how specific characters are to be formatted or indicated using HTML tags. Any physical style tag may contain any item allowed in text, including conventional text, images, line breaks, etc. Although each physical tag has a defined style, you can override that style by defining your own look for each tag. All physical tags require ending tags.<br>
    Example:<br> <img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dhmGxKJBW50/TciXczo12YI/AAAAAAAAADk/tgYWXBX7IbU/s1600/cats.jpg" width="600px" height="400px" alt="">
